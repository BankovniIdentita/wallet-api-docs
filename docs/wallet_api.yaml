    Describes APIs to be implemented by Bank iD.

    * Version 1.1.0
      * updated documentation incorporating findings from POTENTIAL piloting
    * Version 1.0.0
      * the first version of the document for POC purposes

    <details>
    <summary>**Basic Information**</summary>
    Bank iD is only required to implement APIs that are specified in this document, as that is what will be used by the SeP.
    However for additional explanations and details, it is strongly recommended that readers are familiar 
    with the specifications below.


    **Source material and relevant modifications:**

    * [OpenID.Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) OpenID Connect Core 1.0

        * Signed and encrypted JWTs MAY be used for /userinfo and /profile responses

        * In Service Provider's Bank iD relationship the UserInfo Claims MUST be returned as the 
        members of a JSON object unless a signed or encrypted response was requested during 
        Client Registration.

        * The sub (subject) Claim MUST always be returned in the UserInfo Response.

        * If a Claim is not returned, that Claim Name SHOULD be omitted from the JSON object 
        representing the Claims; it SHOULD NOT be present with a null or empty string value.

        * The sub Claim in the UserInfo and Profile Response MUST be verified to exactly match the sub Claim 
        in the ID Token; if they do not match, the UserInfo Response values MUST NOT be used.

        * The UserInfo and Profile Endpoint MUST return a content-type header to indicate which format is 
        being returned and if the response body is a text JSON object; the response body SHOULD 
        be encoded using UTF-8.

        * If the UserInfo or Profile Response is signed and/or encrypted, then the Claims are returned in a 
        JWT and the content-type MUST be application/jwt. The response MAY be encrypted without 
        also being signed. If both signing and encryption are requested, the response MUST be 
        signed then encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT.

      * [OpenID.IdentityAssurance](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-identity-assurance-1_0.html) 
      OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance 1.0

        * The `txn` Claim as defined in [RFC8417](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8417) is used 
        in the context of Bank iD data exchange to build audit trails across the parties involved 
        in an OpenID Connect transaction. Claim txn is always REQUIRED in the userinfo response 
        content.

        * This arrangement introduces the possibility for the bank to separate the verified
         Claims within a container element `verified_claims`. This container is composed of the 
         verification evidence related to a certain verification process and the corresponding 
         Claims about the End-User which were verified in this process.

        * Implementations MUST ignore any sub-element not defined in this specification or 
        extensions of this specification.

        * In the case of this definition verification element MUST consist of the following elements:

          * `trust_framework`: REQUIRED. String determining the trust framework governing the 
          identity verification process. For example, the value of ``cz_aml`` for verification 
          according to the Czech AML law.

          * `time`: OPTIONAL. Time stamp in ISO 8601:2004 [ISO8601-2004] YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss±hh 
          format representing the date and time when identity verification took place.

          * `verification_process`: REQUIRED. In the case of this specification, the verification 
          process shall include the PID issuer identification as stated in PID, which is issuing authority listed in EU trust list

        * Verified Claims can be requested on the level of individual Claims about the End-User 
        by utilizing the claims parameter as defined in Section 5.5. of the OpenID Connect 
        specification [OpenID](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimsParameter)

    * [OpenID.Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html) OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0

    * [OpenID.SessionManagement](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html) OpenID Session Management 1.0

    * [OpenID.Front-ChannelLogout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html)

    * [OpenID.Back-ChannelLogout](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html)

    * [PKCE - RFC7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636) Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients

    * [RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework

    * [RFC6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage

    * [RFC7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection

        The token endpoint is used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant or refresh token.


        The means through which the client obtains the location of the token endpoint are beyond the scope of this specification, but the location
        is typically provided in the service documentation. The endpoint URI **MUST NOT** include a fragment component.


        Since requests to the token endpoint result in the transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and response), the
        authorization server **MUST** require the use of TLS when sending requests to the token endpoint.


        If the Client is a Confidential Client, then it **MUST** authenticate to the token endpoint using the authentication method registered for its client_id,
        as described in Section 9 of [OpenID.Core](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication). 


        Parameters sent without a value **MUST** be treated as if they were omitted from the request. The authorization server MUST ignore
        unrecognized request parameters. Request and response parameters **MUST NOT** be included more than once.

        - invalid_scope -
              The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.

        - server_error -
              The authorization server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
              (This error code is needed because a 500 Internal Server Error HTTP status code cannot be returned to the client
              via an HTTP redirect.)

        - temporarily_unavailable -
              The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading, maintenance
              of the server or planned downtime of Basic Registers.  (This error code is needed because a 503 Service Unavailable HTTP status code cannot be returned
              to the client via an HTTP redirect.)

        - interaction_required -
              The Authorization Server requires End-User interaction of some form to proceed. This error MAY be returned when the prompt
              parameter value in the Authentication Request is none, but the Authentication Request cannot be completed without displaying a
              user interface for End-User interaction.

        - login_required -
              The Authorization Server requires End-User authentication. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in

              authentication.

        - account_selection_required -
              The End-User is REQUIRED to select a session at the Authorization Server. The End-User MAY be authenticated at the Authorization 
              Server with different associated accounts, but the End-User did not select a session. This error MAY be returned when the prompt 
              parameter value in the Authentication Request is none, but the Authentication Request cannot be completed without displaying a 
              user interface to prompt for a session to use.

        - consent_required -
              The Authorization Server requires End-User consent. This error MAY be returned when the prompt parameter value in the 
              Authentication Request is none, but the Authentication Request cannot be completed without displaying a user interface for 
              End-User consent.

          description: >-
            The "key_ops" (key operations) parameter identifies the operation(s) for which the key is intended to be used.  The "key_ops" parameter is
            intended for use cases in which public, private, or symmetric keys may be present.


            Its value is an array of key operation values.  Values defined by  this specification are:
            * "sign" (compute digital signature or MAC)
            * "verify" (verify digital signature or MAC)
            * "encrypt" (encrypt content)
            * "decrypt" (decrypt content and validate decryption, if applicable)
            * "wrapKey" (encrypt key)
            * "unwrapKey" (decrypt key and validate decryption, if applicable)
            * "deriveKey" (derive key)
            * "deriveBits" (derive bits not to be used as a key)

            (Note that the "key_ops" values intentionally match the "KeyUsage" values defined in the Web Cryptography API
            [W3C.CR-WebCryptoAPI-20141211] specification.)


            Other values MAY be used.  The key operation values are case-sensitive strings.  Duplicate key operation values MUST NOT be
            present in the array.  Use of the "key_ops" member is OPTIONAL, unless the application requires its presence.


            Multiple unrelated key operations SHOULD NOT be specified for a key  because of the potential vulnerabilities associated with using the
            same key with multiple algorithms.  Thus, the combinations "sign" with "verify", "encrypt" with "decrypt", and "wrapKey" with
            "unwrapKey" are permitted, but other combinations SHOULD NOT be used.


            Additional "key_ops" (key operations) values can be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Operations" registry established by Section 8.3.
            The same considerations about registering extension values apply to the "key_ops" member as do for the "use" member.


            The "use" and "key_ops" JWK members SHOULD NOT be used together; however, if both are used, the information they convey MUST be
            consistent.  Applications should specify which of these members they use, if either is to be used by the application.

          description: >-
            The "use" (public key use) parameter identifies the intended use of the public key.  The "use" parameter is employed to indicate whether
            a public key is used for encrypting data or verifying the signature on data.


            Values defined by this specification are:
            *  "sig" (signature)
            *  "enc" (encryption)

            Other values MAY be used.  The "use" value is a case-sensitive string.  Use of the "use" member is OPTIONAL, unless the application
            requires its presence.

            When a key is used to wrap another key and a public key use designation for the first key is desired, the "enc" (encryption) key
            use value is used, since key wrapping is a kind of encryption.  The "enc" value is also to be used for public keys used for key agreement
            operations.

            Resistant Name.  The "kty" value is a case-sensitive string.  This member MUST be present in a JWK.


            A list of defined "kty" values can be found in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry established by [JWA]; the initial contents of this
            registry are the values defined in Section 6.1 of [JWA].


            The key type definitions include specification of the members to be used for those key types.  Members used with specific "kty" values
            can be found in the IANA "JSON Web Key Parameters" registry established by Section 8.1.

            not base64url-encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value. The PKIX certificate containing the key value MUST be the first
            certificate.  This MAY be followed by additional certificates, with each subsequent certificate being the one used to certify the

          - **invalid_client** -
                Client authentication failed (e.g., unknown client, no client authentication included, or unsupported authentication method).  The authorization server MAY
                return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code to indicate which HTTP authentication schemes are supported.  If the client attempted to authenticate via the "Authorization"
                request header field, the authorization server MUST respond with an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) status code and include the "WWW-Authenticate" response header field
                matching the authentication scheme used by the client.

          - **invalid_grant** -
                The provided authorization grant (e.g., authorization code, resource owner credentials) or refresh token is invalid, expired, revoked, does not match the redirection
                URI used in the authorization request, or was issued to another client.

          - **unauthorized_client** -

          - **unsupported_grant_type** - 
                The authorization grant type is not supported by the authorization server.

          - **invalid_scope** -
                The requested scope is invalid, unknown, malformed, or exceeds the scope granted by the resource owner.

          Values for the "error" parameter MUST NOT include characters outside the set %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-7E.

        * **error_description**

            If present in the Authentication Request, Authorization Servers MUST include a nonce Claim in the ID Token with the Claim Value being the nonce value sent in the Authentication Request. 
            Authorization Servers SHOULD perform no other processing on nonce values used. The nonce value is a case sensitive string.
            In case of Logout ID Token a nonce Claim MUST NOT be present.
